"""Splitter and merger for multi-view, multi-layer OpenEXR files."""

# EXR images have multiple channels, which specify the components of an image (R,
# G and B for example). It allows "layers", defined as sets of channels that
# logically belong together. They must be named as:
# layername.channel (eg. window.R)
# Many programs will look for default channel names in the default layer and
# accept only channels named R, G, B and A. exrsplit extracts all layer
# information from an EXR image into separate EXR images. It also handles some
# nonstandard naming schemes (read further).
#
# Layers may also be nested, so layers contained in others can be represented
# (so layername = layer[.sublayer]*.channel). For example:
# room.door.R, room.door.G, room.door.B, room.desk.R, room.desk.G, room.desk.B
#
# The specification also supports multi-view files. They allow the description
# of multiple point of view of the same scene in a file. For example, stereo
# images might use left and right channels. The multiView attribute lists views
# in a file. The first one is the view of the default channels. So, for example,
# the image:
# multiView = ['left', 'right'], channels = ['R', 'G', 'B', 'right.R', 'right.G',
# 'right.B']
# Will be parsed to generate the following output:
# left.R left.G left.B right.R right.G right.B
# In a multiview image, all channels must be kept in a view.
#
# Notice that there is no explicit requirement that a multi-layer image has a
# default layer and many programs that support only single layer files won't open
# them. Apparently, the mistake was noticed and fixed for multi-view files (the
# first multiView attribute represents the default layer, which will be kept
# without layer or view prefixes).
#
# exrsplit will split a multi-layer, multi-view file into many single-layer,
# single-view files. Data channels (such as shadows and Z) are saved as a
# grayscale image. RGB color channels can be saved as separate files per channel
# or merged into RGB images.
#
# The following channels are identified (in upper or lower case) if they are the
# suffix of the channel name (list taken from OpenEXR documentation at
# http://www.openexr.com/documentation.html and other sources):
# R, G, B, A, red, green, blue, alpha, Z, ZBack, AR, AG, AB, X, Y, depth, data,
# shadows, mask, RY, GY, BY, U, V
# Non-identified channels are saved as grayscale.
